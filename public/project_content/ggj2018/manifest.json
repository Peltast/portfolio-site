        "Signal Boost is a toy in which you click nodes to send signals in a map of competing signals and try to have your signal adopted by the map in as few actions as possible.",
        "<br><br>",
        "Each map is procedurally generated with four starting signals that quickly spread, represented by different colors.  ",
        "Once a node has a signal, the player can click on it to take it over, and transmit their own signal from that node.  ",
        "Clicking and holding will result in a much larger transmission, but drains a resource that replenishes automatically over time.",
        "<br><br>",
        "Each node has a memory of the signals it has received recently, and is colored with the blend of those signals to represent the state of that node.  ",
        "The more conflicting signals a node has, the smaller its transmission range is, resulting in contested areas between competing signals."
